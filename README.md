This is a collection of scripts for use with Photoshop.

See [Adobe Photoshop Scripting][1] for more information.

Some scripts require arguments. I've included a launcher script
`invoke_js` written in python to be able to invoke scripts from the
command line and supply any desired arguments to them.

At the moment, there is no particular arrangement of pieces of code
within this project. As the number of utilities grows, I'll try to group
them into larger files if appropriate.

For more information on each particular script, check its code for the
description.

The code can be used freely for any purpose. No warranties provided.
